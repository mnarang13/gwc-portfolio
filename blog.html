        Today was my first day at the GWC Virtual Summer Immersion Program. We reviewed an overview of the program content and guidelines, then 
      did a sisterhood activity, where we drew stick figures and added features according to our random preferences. Lastly, we began learning 
      HTML, and went over the instructions for creating this website. I had a lot of fun meeting everyone, and it seems like an amazing group 
      - I'm super excited for the next two weeks!
